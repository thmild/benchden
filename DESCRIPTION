Description: Full implementation of the 28 distributions introduced as benchmarks for nonparametric density estimation by Berlinet and Devroye (1994) <https://hal.science/hal-03659919>. Includes densities, cdfs, quantile functions and generators for samples as well as additional information on features of the densities. Also contains the 4 histogram densities used in Rozenholc/Mildenberger/Gather (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2010.04.021>.
